# Monorepo Python requirements (convenience entrypoint)
#
# Many docs reference: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
# The actual dependency lists live under `requirements/` and per-project folders.
#
# This file intentionally includes:
# - a lightweight core set (covers most notebooks/docs/tools)
# - test dependencies (so `import pytest` resolves for the test suite)
